## Using NELineLabel
You can use `NELineLabel` Programmatically or in IB.
Don't forget to add width constraints/set custom sizing on your Label, since that's where the line is going to be drawn.

## Customizing NELineLabel

`NELineLabel` supports `IBDesignable` and `IBInspectable`.
You can customize the space between the text and line (`lineSpace`) and the height of the line (`lineHeight`).
